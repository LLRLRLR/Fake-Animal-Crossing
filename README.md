# Fake-Animal-Crossing
Animal Crossing but not the kind you're thinking of and the only Animal here is a turtle.
Mini project to further familarize myself with OOP in python and using a simple GUI package, Turtle.
Through this i was able to leverage the ability of OOP to write a much cleaner and structured code.
